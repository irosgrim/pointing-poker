# Pointing poker

A group of people can join a WebSocket chat room and they will need to agree on something by choosing something from a list of
numbers, names, pictures, colors, etc.

The first person that joins the chat room is going to be moderator for the entire session.

This is work in progress. I still have no clue about what I'm going to build but I need to keep coding.
